I obtained the dataset from Kaggle.
• I extracted dataset into SQL lite database, removed and modified the incomplete, null, and duplicate data.
• Normalized the database and imported the data into the Jupyter notebook for the analysis.
• Performed Bi-variate analysis and created derived variables and then created a new table with updated columns.
• Bi-variate analysis is performed by generating various bar plots to understand the trend between features and the target variable.
• Then I split the dataset to the Training set (70%) and testing set (30%).
• Applied machine learning classification models to the dataset. Machine learning models used for the training were: Logistic regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classification.
• Constructed a dashboard with insights into the data.
